                    <p>The flagship region for mountain tourism is the Albanian Alps, the National Parks of Thethi,
                        Valbona and the Region of Kelmendi. The “Accursed Mountains” are both truly spectacular and
                        virtually impenetrable except for a series of high passes that link the small number of
                        farmsteads and homes in the valleys below to the outside world during the summer months.</p>
                    <h3>The Valbona River Valley lies in the eastern part of the Albanian Alps.</h3>
                    <p>A national park of 8,000 hectares, it is one of the most beautiful natural areas in Albania. The
                        park lies about 22 km from the alpine city of Bajram Curri. Before entering the valley you will
                        find the spring (<strong>vrellen</strong>) of Shoshan, located only 3 km away from Bajram Curri.
                    </p>
                    <p>This spring rushes through limestone fissures on its way to the Valbona River creating an
                        attractive canyon, 2-3 m wide and 50 m deep. After entering the valley, you will pass several
                        picturesque villages. The first, with alpine style houses, is called Dragobia, and it is where
                        the valley narrows. Past Dragobia, at the foot of the mountain where the Cerremi stream joins
                        the Valbona River, is the famous cave where the national hero Bajram Curri was besieged and
                        killed. It was after this event that the city took his name.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p><strong>Valbona is located 25km away from the city of Bajram Curri and is the most important
                            inhabited center of the valley.</strong>It is full of traditional houses that create a
                        picturesque view in symmetry with the natural wonders of the valley, which widens again at this
                        point. In Valbona, there is a comfortable and traditional hotel, or you may have the opportunity
                        to stay at a village home, as the inhabitants’ generosity and hospitality are well known.</p>
                    <p>The area is also known for its characteristic regional cooking, with specialties such
                        as<strong>mazja</strong>,<strong>flija</strong>(a many layered pancake-like
                        dish cooked outdoors over open coals and steamed, often served with local honey),
                        and<strong>pitja</strong>. Beyond Selimaj, the road continues through the valley with
                        breathtaking vistas with rich colors of both spring life and of the snow that covers the nearby
                        craggy peaks.</p>

                    <h4>The final village before you arrive at the source of the Valbona River is Rrogam.</h4>
                    <p>Rrogam is a remote village surrounded by virgin natural landscapes. The entire valley is
                        resplendent with rare colors and beauty. On one side, you see the crystal-clear waters of
                        Valbona, and on the other sharp but verdant mountain face. Until May you can enjoy the contrast
                        of the clean white snow on the treetops against the blue sky. The flora of the national park
                        includes a variety of plants and trees, the most widespread of which are
                        the<a>Hormoq</a>tree. The rest consists of beech woods, walnuts, chestnuts, and wild
                        apple. There are also numerous berries, including wild blueberries and strawberries.</p>

                    <p>The animals in the park include bears, wolves, wild cats, and even herds of wild goats climbing
                        on the cliffs. In the river one can find marble trout, a rare fish found in the crystal-clear
                        waters of the Valbona which has a unique flavor. The valley, the park, and all surrounding area
                        are known for heavy snowfall, which starts in early November and lasts almost until May. The
                        average yearly snowfall in this region<a>is 100 cm</a>.</p>

                    <p>There are many outdoor activities in the national park, such as skiing, mountain climbing,
                        fishing, excursions and trekking throughout the valley and streams (Cerremi, Kukaj), and
                        canoeing along certain parts of the river. Valbona may also serve as a starting point if you
                        wish to climb the Jezerca Mountain, the second highest mountain in Albania.</p>

                    <p>Another interesting spot of the Western Alps is Vermosh, located in the northern-most mountains
                        of Albania, 95 km from Shkodra in the region of Kelmend (from the Roman word “Clemens,” meaning
                        gentle, simple, and good). The first thing that catches your eye along the journey is Qafa e
                        Rrapshit, where you can see the crystal-clear waters of the Cemi River creating a beautiful
                        contrast with the surrounding landscape.</p>
                    <p>During summer, the ponds of the river are perfect for sunbathing and many visitors stop to lounge
                        in the sun and enjoy themselves. Vermosh stands in an alpine field 1,100 m above sea level
                        surrounded by high slopes. You can entertain yourself by trekking, mountain climbing, skiing, or
                        fishing for mountain trout. The locals pride themselves that their cuisine is only truly
                        enjoyable for visitors when accompanied by their own dairy products, so be sure to indulge. A
                        real journey among the people of this region will give you not only the chance to experience a
                        world located between traditional village life and contemporary society, but will also let you
                        enjoy the hospitality renowned by almost every visitor who has been fortunate enough to visit.

                    <p>An alpine tour of Albania isn’t complete without a stop in the famed Western Albanian Alps,
                        (<strong>Alpet Perëndimore</strong>). Here you will enjoy the unique opportunity to walk,
                        breath, sleep, and eat amidst the legends dating from Homer and through modern tales of our
                        majestic mystery and intrigue. This tour gives you the rare chance to enjoy the heart of the
                        Albanian Alps, Gropa e Thethit. The journey begins from the cultural capital of Shkodra and
                        wanders 41 km away to the village of Razma.</p>

                        of pine and birch trees. Meadows and amazing alpine pastures abound, drenching any visitor with
                        a keen eye in the beauty of the Balkans. Even in the depths of winter when the snow drifts tout
                        highest level of the season, adventure tourists visit Razma. Several hotels already exist and
                        others are being completed. Common activities on the excursions are mountain climbing, skiing,
                        and, weather permitting, camping. The road turns from Razma to the village of Dedaj and then
                        onto Boga, a village surrounded by the Alps and described by Edith Durham in her
                        book,<strong>“The Burden of the Balkans.”</strong></p>

                        (Mill), Akullore (Ice Cream), and Njerëzve të lagun (Wet People).</p>

                        in Theth. The fauna is just as rich as the flora, distinguished by the famed golden eagle and
