The “Accursed Mountains” are both truly spectacular and virtuallyimpenetrable except for a series of high passes that link the small number of farmsteads and homes in the valleys below to  the outside world during the summer months. </p>

            <h3>5 Amazing Places to visit in Albania</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                <div>
                <p>For visitors looking for something off the beaten track, Albania, a small and yet unexplored
                            corner of the Mediterranean, is the perfect place for nature lovers and beachgoers alike. If
                            you are gearing up for a visit, here are thirteen spots that are not to be missed.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Shala River</strong></p>
                <div class="image"><img src="./images/5_amazing/shala_river.jpg">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Often called the Thailand of Albania, Shala
                            River is a hidden gem that is home to some of the most stunning landscapes in the country.
                            Concealed inside the Albanian Alps in the north, this destination is accessible only by
                            boat. To reach it, follow the road to Vau i Dejës, and then take the boat to Lake Koman.
                            Shala River is the perfect summer destination, a respite from the heat and an opportunity to
                            be one with nature.</p>
                <p><strong>2. The Blue Eye, Theth</strong></p>
                <div class="image"><img src="./images/5_amazing/theth-eye.jpg"></div>
                <p>The Blue Eye of Theth is often shadowed by its better-known southern counterpart, but it is
                            a magnificent blue-green pool hidden in the northern Albanian Alps, close to the village of
                            Kaprre. To reach the Blue Eye of Theth, visitors must pass through the Grunas waterfall,
                            another majestic beauty. Even in the middle of summer, the air is crisp and offers an
                            unforgettable panorama. Nearby, visitors can take advantage of a small clearing in the woods
                            for a picnic, or just to relax.</p>

                        <p><strong>3. The Blue Eye, Saranda</strong></p>
                        <p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="./images/5_amazing/blue-eye.jpg">
                        </div>
                        </p>
                        <p>Perhaps one of the most well-known destinations in Albania, many tourists from around the
                            globe flock to the Blue Eye of Saranda, a spring with chilly waters and an arresting blue
                            color that bubbles forth from a deep pool. While divers have explored fifty meters of its
                            depths, its actual size is unclear. The water itself is a constant 10 degrees Celsius,
                            requiring some fortitude to wade forth in its midst. But the experience is worth it. The
                            Blue Eye spring is the initial water source of Bistricë river whose mouth is in the Ionian
                            Sea, south of Saranda, Albania.</p>


                        <p><strong>4. Cyclops Eye</strong></p>
                        <p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="./images/5_amazing/cikllopi.jpg">
                        </div>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The lake and the surrounding area known as the Eye of the Cyclops (Syri i Cikllopit) is a
                            popular weekend getaway among residents of Tirana and the area. While well-frequented, it is
                            still considered a hidden gem with a mythical past, and attracts those looking to explore
                            nature, or spend a few hours in absolute peace. The area features unique small cataracts
                            surrounded by rock formations, creating a singular and unrepeatable panorama.</p>


                        <p><strong>5. The Casted Sand (Rana e Hedhun)</strong></p>
                        <p>
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="./images/5_amazing/rana_hedhun_01.jpg">
                        </div>
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>On the foothills that surround the coastal town of Shëngjin, hides the famous beach of Rana e
                            Hedhun (“The Casted Sand”). While famous with locals, this destination remains unexplored by
                            foreigner tourists, or even some Albanians. Its landscape is quite unusual, consisting of
                            hills of sand that descend into the sea. The area is surrounded by evergreen pine trees,
                            offering shelter from the sun and the perfect place for campaign and picnics even during off
                            season.</p>
